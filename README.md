# Mips-Architecture
Final task at "CPU Architecture" course. VHDL coding and working with FPGA.
In this project I added some instructions to MIPS architecture using VHDL.
In addition, creating a memory mapped I/O interface.
Loading the project to FPGA and run an Assembly code to check the architecture and the GPIO interface(Conected to leds the LCD on the FPGA Board).
